# Formula 1 Drivers Standings 2022

I used the [Ergast web service](http://ergast.com/mrd/) to do this application.
<br>
<br>
On this website page you can find the Formula 1 2022 Drivers Standings. Here you can see the driver position, the driver's name, his constructor team and the points in this season.
<br>
<br>
If you want, you can use the dark mode in the page. You need to click in the toggle to activate dark mode.

You can find the site by clicking <a href="https://formula1driverstandings.netlify.app">here</a>
